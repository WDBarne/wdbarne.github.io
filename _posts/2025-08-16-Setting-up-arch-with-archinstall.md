H1 - Why Arch?

I initially hopped between a number of linux distros before landing on Arch, Linux Mint Cinnamon was my first and one of my favorite distros. I would happily recommend it to anyone wanting to get into using Linux on their PC.

Arch was something I gravitated towards because it was touted as a difficult OS for beginners by many forums, and I figured I had the free time and motivation to dive in and see what it was all about.

You can download ArchLinux here:

Once the .ISO image is installed, you can use a Bootable Media Creation app in order to flash the .ISO image to a USB drive.

Once this image is installed, access the BIOS on your PC (you will have to look up the hotkeys for your motherboard model). From there, boot your system from the USB to enter the bootloader menu and select Arch Linux.
